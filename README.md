# Web Journey 


<p>This is my personal journey to further improve my web development skill with only my knowledge of XAML. I will improve my skills throught videos and documentations. I will use tailwind css even thought I have no knowledge in css and a little knowldge in html. If you would like to test any of the code you can used your perfer editor or https://play.tailwindcss.com/ which is what I am currently using.</p>
